Click [**here**](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/description/) to visit page.

## Description
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return *the total area covered by the two rectangles*.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner ```ax1, ay1``` and its top-right corner ```ax2, ay2```.

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner ```bx1, by1``` and its top-right corner ```bx2, by2```.

**Example 1:**

- Input: ```ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2```
- Output: ```45```

**Example 2:**
- Input: ```ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2```
- Output: ```16```

## Constraints:
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= by1 <= by2 <= 10<sup>4</sup>
